<p>To contribute follow these steps:</p>

### 1. Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

### 2. Clone the repository


Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the **copy to clipboard** icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```bash
git clone <url you just copied>
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

For example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/leetsource.git
```

### 3. Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd leetsource
```

Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:

```
git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
```

For example:

```
git checkout -b <add-your-branch-name>
```

That `<add-your-branch-name>` can be replaced by anything except `main` and `dev` because they already exist!

### 4. Make some changes

Now you can open the project on vscode and add features, fix errors, or optimize code.

When you finish make sure you commit those changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message should make sense!"
```

### 5. Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push origin <add-your-branch-name>
```

replacing `<add-your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

### 6. Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.

Now submit the pull request.

Soon I'll be merging all your changes into the main branch of this project. You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.
